      ### About Dylan Burkey The developer and person


      I was born in Cleveland, Ohio on July 19th 1989. Once I arrived home from
      the hospital I began white boarding what we now know as the internet. \

      \

      A child prodigy, at the age of eight I began porting my work over to the
      DoD and Al Gore. Once the Internet became a reality, I made the most of
      it.
