    headline: Developing for Web3
    text: >
      Developing for Web3 needs to be thought as of a privilege. Not many people
      are developing for Web3. The few that are absolutely need to be the best
      of the best.


      Web3 should have taken off at least two years ago. We are stuck in an
      endless loop of fund project, build project, wait a year or two to make
      money, slowly lose traction, fall of the radar and repeat.


      Couple that with what seems like a new rollup, chain, and airdrop every
      day. How do you think someone entering Web3 for the first time is going to
      feel? It's overwhelming and confusing. In our effort to build and create
      exciting decentralized projects, we've forgotten the user. When the
      project is more important then the user, stop and reevaluate. 


      Performance, UI/UX, Accessibility, Semantic HTML, and progressive
      enhancement have lost  out to project delivery deadlines. If we continue
      to treat users like second class citizens don't be surprised when they
      don't come back. \

      \

      **How do we fix things?**


      We need to get back to the basics. New HTML elements coupled with what is
      being coined CSS4 can do the majority of what you see across Web3 today.
      The need for a Next.js Web App is few and far between. A quick SSG using
      "boring" HTML and CSS coupled with a templating engine and your set. 


      Start using semantic and HTML and you will improve your performance,
      accessibility, SEO and overall user experience.

      My name is Dylan Burkey, and I'm a seasoned web engineer with 23 years of
      experience. A Forbes Web3 Legacy pass holder, and deeply invested in the
      future of Web3.


      I'm proficient in just about every development framework in addition to
      numerous backend languages and passionate about leveraging user behavior
      to drive data-driven development decisions. \

      I put this together using Next.js and Tina (Headless CMS) as both a use
      case and potentially a long term blog.

      Web3 has changed the way we work online. Much like Web2, the excitment can
      be felt by just about everyone who involved.


      That is the major issue, its exciting to those of us involved. The
      majority of Crypto holders or people in general have no idea what Web3 is,
      how to start using it, and just when they get the hang of things a new
      rollup or chain is dropped, \

      \

      Web3 is an absolute mess and has been from day one.. Developers need to
      step up or Web3 will be something we remember as opposed to the
      decentralized web that saved rhe world.
