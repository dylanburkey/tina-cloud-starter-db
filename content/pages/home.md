      ## A bit about me


      My name is Dylan Burkey, and I'm a seasoned web engineer with 23 years of
      experience. A Forbes Web3 Legacy pass holder, and deeply invested in the
      future of Web3.


      I'm proficient in just about every development framework in addition to
      numerous backend languages and passionate about leveraging user behavior
      to drive data-driven development decisions. \

      \

      I put this together using Next.js and Tina (Headless CMS) as both a use
      case and potentially a long term blog.
