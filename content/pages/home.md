      ## A bit about me


      My name is Dylan Burkey, and I'm a seasoned web engineer with 23 years of
      experience. A Forbes Web3 Legacy pass holder, and deeply invested in the
      future of Web3.


      I'm proficient in just about every development framework in addition to
      numerous backend languages and passionate about leveraging user behavior
      to drive data-driven development decisions. \

      \

      I put this together using Next.js and Tina (Headless CMS) as both a use
      case and potentially a long term blog.

      Web3 has changed the way we work online. Much like Web2, the excitment can
      be felt by just about everyone who involved. 


      That is the major issue, its exciting to those of us involved. The
      majority of Crypto holders or people in general have no idea what Web3 is,
      how to start using it, and just when they get the hang of things a new
      rollup or chain is dropped, \

      \

      Web3 is an absolute mess and has been from day one.. Developers need to
      step up or Web3 will be something we remember as opposed to the
      decentralized web that saved rhe world.
