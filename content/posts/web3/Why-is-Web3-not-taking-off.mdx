title: Why is Web3 not taking off?
excerpt: >
  I've been working with crypto since 2015-2016, witnessing the ups and downs of
  an industry finding its footing.


  That was nearly a decade ago, and we still haven't come far. The industry
  remains a mess, from centralized exchanges (CEX) to decentralized exchanges
  (DEX), to all the cool things we can build.


  I often wonder why I was accepted for the Forbes 30 Under 30 Legacy Pass. I
  didn't use spell-check, reread what I wrote, or do anything responsible. I
  simply explained that we're all in trouble within the next two years if we
  can't get decentralization right.
