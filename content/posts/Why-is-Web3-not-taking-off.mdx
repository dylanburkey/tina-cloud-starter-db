title: Why is Web3 not taking off?
excerpt: >
  I've been working with crypto since 2015-2016, witnessing the ups and downs of
  an industry finding its footing.


  That was nearly a decade ago, and we still haven't come far. The industry
  remains a mess, from centralized exchanges (CEX) to decentralized exchanges
  (DEX), to all the cool things we can build.


  I often wonder why I was accepted for the Forbes 30 Under 30 Legacy Pass. I
  didn't use spell-check, reread what I wrote, or do anything responsible. I
  simply explained that we're all in trouble within the next two years if we
  can't get decentralization right.

## Issues:

- Web3 Perception

I recently completed my Marketing Mini-MBA, where Web3 was consistently mocked—not just by students, but also by industry leaders. It's embarrassing to have Web3 ridiculed by classmates and instructors alike.

**Are they right to laugh?**

**Yes!** Web3 is genuinely problematic, and I believe others must recognize this. While I appreciate the rapid pace of innovation and the influx of new projects, there are significant issues. With over 40 wallets and no **easy** central access point for Web3 content, users have become second-class citizens—a frightening development.

### Remember "Users"?? Those people who use your project.

Users were once paramount; when treated well, they returned to your website. Web3 has taken the opposite approach: build as quickly as possible, using unnecessary tools, disregarding performance, and forgetting that not all users have 60-inch 4K screens with fiber internet.

We're launching impressive products, but the user experience is lacking. I challenge you to ask someone unfamiliar with crypto to open a Web3 site and try to decipher its purpose.

While I may understand it, our goal should be to grow the industry, not just cater to the few who already grasp these concepts.

I'll conclude with some key points:

React is not the solution for every project.

- Some projects do require it, but from my observations, it's necessary for about 45% or fewer.
- Accessibility: We've failed to make Web3 inclusive, repeating the mistakes of Web2:
    - Font sizes are too small.
    - Contrast between elements is insufficient.
    - ARIA roles are neglected.
    - The dismissive attitude that "blind people aren't trading crypto or using Web3" exemplifies the mentality that has hindered Web3's progress for five years.
- "Performance doesn't matter."
    - This statement is shocking. I could write a book on the importance of performance.
    - Performance is crucial—if anyone tells you otherwise, end the conversation.

> What I loved about Web2 is that we pushed web development forward. Dektop become responsive sites, we made so much progress. Now we seem fine with React and Tailwinds.

We need sites that put the user first and challange the industry. Every Web3 front end is a carbon copy of the next. This is becoming the issue with Web3 sites connecting to wallets. The service provided it subpar, nobody seems to care. We have you’re money, we are the cool new project and you’ll get an airdrop.
